                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Silent Voice was created to provide a safe, non-judgmental online space for people experiencing emotional difficulties such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, family issues, relationship troubles, or stress. We believe that everyone deserves to be heard and supported, especially during their most vulnerable moments.</p>

                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>Mental health struggles can be isolating and overwhelming. Sometimes, people need a place to express their feelings without fear of judgment or consequences. Traditional social media platforms often lack the anonymity and supportive environment necessary for genuine emotional expression.</p>

                <p>Silent Voice fills this gap by providing a platform where users can share their thoughts and feelings anonymously, knowing they will be met with compassion and understanding from a community that truly cares.</p>

                <h2>Our Values</h2>
